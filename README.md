<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

It's pretty simple... 
* Get a free account at [LaunchDarkly](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/getting-started) (if you don't already have one)
  * Create an LaunchDarkly SDK (API) Access Token and a Feature Flag as part of the getting started process
  * Copy and save the LaunchDarkly SDK Key for use later
* Get a free account with [OpenWeatherMap.org](https://openweathermap.org) and create an API Token
* clone this [repository](https://github.com/wasabibob/my-weather-app). then build, run & test

### Prerequisites

* Install Python3 [installation package](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* Ensure you can run [pip](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/installing-packages/#ensure-pip-setuptools-and-wheel-are-up-to-date)

## Build

1. Ensure you have registered for a [free trial account](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/getting-started#1-sign-up-for-a-free-trial) with LaunchDarkly
1. Create an [Personal Access Token](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/account/api-create/?q=create+access#create-access-tokens) for your SDK API connection giving the Role `writer` access
   **Copy and save the token value for future use** 
1. [Create a Feature Flag](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/getting-started#3-create-your-first-feature-flag) named `new-banner`to use for this exercise
1. Set the environment variable `LAUNCHDARKLY_SDK_KEY` to your LaunchDarkly SDK key. If there is an existing boolean feature flag in your LaunchDarkly project that you want to evaluate, set `LAUNCHDARKLY_FLAG_KEY` to the flag key; In this exaqmple webapp it should be `new-banner`.
    ```bash
    export LAUNCHDARKLY_SDK_KEY="1234567890abcdef"
    export LAUNCHDARKLY_FLAG_KEY="new-banner"
    ```
    NOTE: you can optionally set the environment variable "CI" to skip evaluating the feature flag

1.  Clone the repo
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:wasabibob/my-weather-app
    ```
    
1. Install Python Virtual Environment, waitress and the LaunchDarkly SDK
   ```bash
   cd my-weather-app
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   pip install requests python-dotenv Flask
   pip install --upgrade pip
   pip install waitress
   pip install launchdarkly-server-sdk
   ```
   
1. Create .env file for environment variables, and put your OpenWeatherMap API key and the LaunchDarkly Key in this file
   ```bash
   cd my-weather-app
   touch .env
   echo "API_KEY=<put your OpenWeatherMap API key here>" >>.env
   echo "LAUNCHDARKLY_SDK_KEY=<put your LaunchDarkly SDK key here>" >>.env
   ```    
   
## Run Lcally
   See the feature live Run the python app image in your local environment from the terminal window
   
### In a terminal window From the application source home directory (my-weather-app)
* To run in CLI mode (one-off) and validate your connection to OpenWeatherMap.org and LaunchDarkly
   ```bash
   python3 weather.py
   ```
   Enter a city on the command line prompt and it will connect to the API and return weather data

* To run the this app in the Flask webserver. Once running, you can see the app by opening a browser and browsing to **localhost:8000**
   ```bash
   python3 server.py
   ```
   NOTE: You should receive the message in the CLI "The **FLAG KEY** feature flag evaluates to **FLAG VALUE**"\
         The application will run continuously and react to the flag changes in LaunchDarkly
## Test

### From desktop browser

1. Navigate to **locahost:8000/weather** and enter a city to retrieve weather information
2. Toggle the LaunchDarkly Flag to turn on or off the travel banner
