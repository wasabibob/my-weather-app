The instructions need to
explain â€” in detail â€” how the reader can run the example locally on their machine. Be sure to
include relevant comments in the code, (e.g. where the SDK key needs to be replaced, or where a
feature flag needs to be re-created by the user, etc.).

Once running, you can see the app by opening a browser and browsing to **localhost:5500**

### In a terminal

From the application source home directory (demo-py-app)
```python3 weather.py
   ```

1. Navigate to images tab and locate your most recent build (typicaly at the bottom of the list)
2. Click on the play/run button under the Actions column
3. In the **Run a new container** diaglog box, under **Optional setting**, replace **Host port** with the value **5500**
4. Click **Run**
